        “Lord Verath!”<br>
        “Halduron!” her father called as Halduron, Jirri,<br>
        and the dragonhawks approached. Although she was<br>
        clearly trying to control her emotions, the normally<br>
        smiling Jirri was pale and almost . . . frightened?<br>
        “My lord, you must return to the spire at once,”<br>
        Jirri said “Lady Lireesa has gone into labor!”<br>
        Sylvanas had never seen her father look so<br>
        distressed. “But the child isn’t due for several<br>
        weeks—”

        “Apparently, someone neglected to inform the child,”<br>
        Halduron retorted. His effort at lightening the mood<br>
        was received with worried silence as Verath handed<br>
        Vereesa to him. He settled the girl safely in front<br>
        of him while Jirri slipped off her dragonhawk and<br>
        Verath and Sylvanas climbed atop it.<br>
        Sylvanas was not particularly interested in children<br>
        other than her younger sister; nor had she given<br>
        much thought to having children of her own. Alleria<br>
        was the only one who needed to produce the future<br>
        ranger-general. She sat behind her father, arms<br>
        around his waist, resting her cheek on his back.<br>
        Verath’s reaction had unsettled her, and she was<br>
        doing her utmost not to worry. Her mother had<br>
        doubtless summoned some of the finest healers in the<br>
        land the moment it became apparent that the newest<br>
        addition to the family was determined to join it<br>
        ahead of schedule.

        Sylvanas and her father leaped off the dragonhawks<br>
        almost before the creatures were close enough to<br>
        land. Halduron handed Vereesa back to her father,<br>
        and Verath and Sylvanas raced up the stairs. A<br>
        sensitive child, Vereesa had picked up on the<br>
        tension and started crying the moment they departed,<br>
        much to Halduron’s consternation, and she now was<br>
        sobbing at full tilt. There was no sound from above,<br>
        of another child crying its first breath. Sylvanas<br>
        did not think she had ever been truly afraid of<br>
        anything in her life, but suddenly fear locked her<br>
        in its cold grasp. She was clumsy as she ran.<br>
        Despite his weeping burden, Verath reached the room<br>
        before Sylvanas, vanishing into the quarters he and<br>
        his wife shared. Sylvanas stumbled in a second<br>
        after, bracing for the worst.
